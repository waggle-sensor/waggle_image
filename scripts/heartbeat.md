# Operation

The heartbeat service continuously turns on and off a General Purpose IO (GPIO) pin on the C1+ or XU4 board.

# C1+ Dead Man Trigger

Turning the GPIO pin on is dependent on the modification time of the file
/usr/lib/waggle/alive being within 60 seconds of the current system time. The
modification time of the alive file is periodically updated by the wellness
service. See the documentation on the wellness service
(https://github.com/waggle-sensor/nodecontroller/tree/NC_wellness/scripts/wellness-service.md)
for details on what conditions cause the alive file modification time to not be updated.
